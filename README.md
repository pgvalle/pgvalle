## Please, read this!

**John 3:11,16-18**  
*11* "(...) Very truly I tell you, we speak of what we know, and we testify to what we have seen, but still you people do not accept our testimony. (...)"   
*16* For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.  
*17* For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him.  
*18* Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of Godâ€™s one and only Son.  

May God bless you, and may you turn yourself to God through Jesus Christ.
Believe and confess he is your only Lord and Savior.
Amen.
